# BFFP Brand Audit Data Cleanup and Analysis

Welcome to the repo for the [Break Free From Plastic](https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/) Brand Audit data analysis for the publication "Global Producer Responsibility for Plastic Pollution"

Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/wincowgerDEV/BFFP/issues) for any questions, comments, or bugs. 

## [code.R](https://github.com/wincowgerDEV/BFFP/blob/main/code.R)
Code to do primary data analysis and cleanup for the brand audit publication. 

## [github_data](https://github.com/wincowgerDEV/BFFP/tree/main/github_data)
All datasets currently implemented in the code.R script. 

## [raw_processed_data.csv](https://github.com/wincowgerDEV/BFFP/blob/main/raw_processed_data.csv)
The most complete and rawest form of the dataset that can be used to reproduce all results. This should be used in most cases instead of the data in github_data and can be reproduced or expanded upon by leveraging the datasets in github_data. The .RData version of this file is more reproducible than .csv when working in an R environment. 

## [data_descriptions.csv](https://github.com/wincowgerDEV/BFFP/blob/main/data_descriptions.csv)
Full descriptions of the fields of raw_processed_data and other datasets that live in github_data.
